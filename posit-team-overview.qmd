## Posit Team

Posit Team is a bundled offering of Posit's three professional data science tools including Posit Workbench, Posit Connect, and Posit Package Manager. These tools are designed to fully support end-to-end data science workflows in both R and Python from code development, sharing data products, and managing environments.

### Posit Workbench

Data scientist leverage Posit Workbench to *create insights* (@fig-pst-overview). As the name implies, Posit Workbench contains numerous "tools" for insight development, including a variety of integrated development environments (IDEs) to choose from. Currently, Posit Workbench supports Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, RStudio Pro and Visual Studio Code (@fig-pw-new-session).

The IDEs included within Posit Workbench will *look* and *feel* very similar to the versions that are freely available to the public. This is by design to ensure users feel at home within Posit Workbench on day one. There are, however, a few features that you will only find within Posit Workbench which will be discussed in the next section.

#### Features unique to Posit Workbench

Many of the [features](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/) that make Posit Workbench appealing for data science teams are tailored to system administrators, IT, and security teams including load balancing, cluster integration, authentication, session management, and security. From the users perspective, there are a handful of features that are worth knowing about which you'll only find within Posit Workbench including:

-   Flexible use of multiple versions of R and Python on the same server.

-   Project sharing (RStudio Pro) for easy collaboration within work groups.

-   Launch long-running scripts (R and Python) in new sessions independent of your current working session.

### Posit Connect

Data scientists leverage Posit Connect to *share insights* with others (@fig-pst-overview). These insights can take many forms including interactive web applications, static reports, application programming interfaces (APIs), and more. Once the insights have been published to Connect (possibly from Posit Workbench), the publisher has full control over sharing, access, and content execution.

#### Publishing Options

![Publishing methods](images/publishing-methods.png){#fig-publishing-methods fig-align="center"}

Users have multiple options for publishing content to Posit Connect, summarized in @fig-publishing-methods.

-   **Command Line:** The `rsconnect-python` package contains a command line interface (CLI) tools for publishing content from the command line/terminal. During the publishing process, the user's environment with automatically be captured and replicated on the Posit Connect server. This method is available anywhere you have access to a terminal/command line, including Jupyter Lab and VS Code.

-   **Push-Button Deployment**: Available within RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks (within Posit Workbench). During the publishing process, the user's environment with automatically be captured and replicated on the Posit Connect server.

-   **R:** The `rsconnect` R package makes it easy to publish content to Posit Connect from R.

-   **Git**: Deploy content directly from a git repository. In this method, the user needs to supply a companion `manifest.json` file which includes information about the environment needed to run the content on Posit Connect.

### Posit Package Manager

Data scientists leverage Posit Package Manager to access R and Python packages from repositories managed and hosted from within your organization. Often, Posit Package Manager is considered a "behind the scenes" tool, but it's importance should not be underestimated. Users of Posit Package Manager often find that their package installs and development environments "just work" without any prior configuration. However, it's still important that users know *how* to install packages from an instance of Posit Package Manager.
